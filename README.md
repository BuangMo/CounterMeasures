# CounterMeasures

For generations, the bats of Mogokgo Caves navigated their habitat using echolocation. Now, however, chaos reigned. Young bats entrusted with food gathering were not returning, and supplies dwindled to their lowest point in King Koki's six-month reign. Six youngins remained missing, the last one being King Koki's favorite son, Prince Rea, the second eldest of his eight children. The King had envisioned a lifelong partner in the Queen he tragically lost during the birth of Prince Rea and without a mother to care for him, the King made do to raise him.

Unease settled in on the third day of Prince Rea's absence. He usually returned with food location intelligence by the second night, but dawn approached on the third. Determined to investigate, King Koki disregarded his advisors' warnings. He argued that many young bats were missing, and hunger threatened their lives. The advisors conceded, agreeing on the need for answers. If the King was going, they insisted on a escort of young and old bats – the young at the forefront, the King in the middle, and the elders at the rear. The King relented, and they all agreed to embark on their investigative journey that night.

As night fell, the King found the young and old bats assembled in the cave square, ready to depart. They formed their flight pattern and set off, flying lower and slower than usual to anticipate any dangers. The young bats were tasked with navigating them out of the cave.

Their suspicions of impending danger were confirmed just as they neared the Mogokgo Caves' exit. The young bats leading the way accidentally struck the lower wall and plummeted. King Koki froze, ordering the trailing elders to halt. He strained his ears, picking up sounded like echo returns despite no transmissions from the remaining bats.

He descended to the ground, using his wings and feet to navigate. There, he found a grim discovery – a pile of bat corpses, some cold, others still warm. He counted eleven in total, six matching the previously missing youngsters, and five deceased only moments ago. One of them was undeniably Prince Rea, his dear son.

The King retraced his steps and flew slightly ahead of the waiting elders. The "echo returns" persisted, though no one transmitted. He considered the possibility of other bats near the entrance interfering with their echolocation technique. Yet, he detected no bat scent besides the decaying bodies of their young below.

The signals he received mirrored those of bats, but without transmitting himself, he couldn't determine the source's distance. That's when he decided to transmit. However, the echo returns were outside the range of his own transmission. He transmitted again, this time at a much higher pitch. After a 17-millisecond wait, he received the reflected sound of his high-pitched signal. From this, he determined the next object in front of him was approximately 3 meters away.

He flew towards it, reasoning that any attacker would have struck by now. As he got closer, the intensity of the received signals increased. Eventually, he landed on the metallic object, which hummed with an incomprehensible sound. This was the source of the strange signals.

King Koki's suspicion hardened. Humans. Only those arrogant bullies, with their utter disregard for other creatures, would disrupt everything – air, water, land. They possessed the cunning, he thought grimly, to create such an advanced system. Why they couldn't coexist with other species they'd mostly conquered remained a mystery to him. Now, it seemed, they were setting their sights on the cave dwellers. But deep in his heart, King Koki dared to believe he could protect his own. He was their king, and their survival was his sacred duty.

He returned to the elder bats and repeated the high-pitched sound. The results were consistent – for some reason, the human machine couldn't replicate this sound. This, he realised, was the new key to navigating the Mogokgo Caves – the caves where they were all born and were they were raising their young.

With newfound purpose, King Koki instructed the elders to descend and collect their fallen kin for a proper burial.

But this was not over. A war of sound was about to commence, and the bats would be the aggressors. Previous creatures had made the fatal mistake of passivity against the humans. That's why they ended up in zoos, their resources plundered, and their bodies processed in horrific machines to feed the ever-growing human population.

The bats, however, would take the fight to these earth-fouling beasts. All bats, united as one, would rise to challenge this problematic specimen.
